Project for 309 at Iowa State.

The app features a Spring Backend that interfaces with an Android App using a [Rest API](https://rmd.duba.sh/swagger-ui/).

309's description
> Practical introduction to methods for managing software development. Software engineering concepts, practices and tools. Requirements analysis, structured and object-oriented design, coding, testing, and maintenance. Software process models, software tools and environments. Programming projects that provide exposure to information management techniques, client/server model, networking and communication. 

In my freetime, I deployed the Backend to AWS.
It most likely will not stay up, but feel free to check out the Github Actions
and CloudFormation templates.
