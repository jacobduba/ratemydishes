# Rate My Dishes

Project for 309 at Iowa State.

The app features a Spring Backend that interfaces with an Android App using a Rest API. [Link to achived OpenAPI spec of API](https://archive.ph/YiC4o).

309's description
> Practical introduction to methods for managing software development. Software engineering concepts, practices and tools. Requirements analysis, structured and object-oriented design, coding, testing, and maintenance. Software process models, software tools and environments. Programming projects that provide exposure to information management techniques, client/server model, networking and communication. 

In my freetime, I deployed the Backend to AWS.
I have since taken it down, but feel free to check out the infrastructure as code.
